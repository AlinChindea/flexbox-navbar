# Flexbox Navbar

This is a responsive navbar burger menu and sticky footer built using flexbox. While CSS frameworks such as Bulma or Bootstrap provide comfortable solutions, building a navbar from scratch using Flexbox is easier that you'd imagine. As a code newbie, I noticed that coding tests during a hiring interview might ask you to replicate a certain website - structure and style - without using CSS frameworks. This might come in handy. I also like to have reusable snippets of code at hand.

I have added a sticky footer - a potential nightmare for newbies (not in the same zip code with the "fatal error" message you sometimes get in code editors). The purpose of a sticky footer is that it "sticks" to the bottom of the browser window. If there is enough content on the page to push the footer lower, it will stick to the bottom. If the content on the page is short, a sticky footer will still hang to the bottom of the browser window. For details see this [article](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/).
